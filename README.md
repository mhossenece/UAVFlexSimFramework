# UAV Wireless Network Digital Twin Simulation Framework

We have developed a **measurement-calibrated MATLAB-based simulation framework** designed to replicate performance in a full-stack **UAV wireless network digital twin (DT)**. 

In particular, we use the DT from the [NSF AERPAW platform](https://aerpaw.org/) and compare its reports with those generated by our developed simulation framework in wireless networks with similar settings.

## Features
- **Fixed and Autonomous UAV Trajectories** with a geofence.
- Two separate projects for better organization.
- MATLAB-based implementation.

## How to Run the Fixed Trajectory

1. Navigate to the folder **`Fixed Trajectory`**.  
2. Run the MATLAB script:  
   ```matlab
   main_fixed_trajectory.m
