We have developed a measurement-calibrated Matlab-based simulation framework designed to replicate performance in a full-stack UAV wireless network DT. In particular, we use the DT from the NSF AERPAW platform, and compare its reports with those generated by our developed simulation framework in wireless networks with similar settings. 

We implemented fixed and autonomous trajectory with a geofence. For simplicity, we have kept two different projects in two separate folders.

**How to run the fixed trajectory**

Go to the folder 'Fixed Trajectory'. Run the file "main_fixed_trajectory.m" Following is a sample picture of autonomous trajectory.
