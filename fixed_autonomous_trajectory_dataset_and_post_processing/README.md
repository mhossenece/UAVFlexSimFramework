This repository contains a **measurement-calibrated MATLAB-based simulation framework** designed to replicate and compare the performance of a full-stack **UAV wireless network digital twin (DT)**.

We use real-world measurements from the **NSF AERPAW platform** and compare them with results from a **measurement-calibrated MATLAB-based simulation framework** to validate and analyze UAV wireless network behavior. More information about the simulation framework is available at:

This dataset includes three main folders:

### 1. `fixed_trajectory_rsrp_emulation`
- **Contents**: Processed dataset from the AERPAW Digital Twin using the LTE SISI experiment.
- **Description**: The UAV follows a **fixed trajectory** while recording RSRP measurements from surrounding base stations.
- **Post-processing Scripts**:
  - `plot_rsrp_emulation.m`: Plots RSRP measurements over time.
  - `plot_rsrp_distance_emulation.m`: Plots RSRP vs. distance for four base stations.

---

### 2. `fixed_trajectory_rsrp_simulation`
- **Contents**: Simulated dataset generated by the MATLAB-based framework under the same conditions as the emulation.
- **Description**: Mimics the fixed-trajectory scenario, enabling a **side-by-side comparison** with AERPAW's digital twin results.
- **Post-processing Scripts**:
  - Same logic as above, with different identifiers to distinguish simulation from emulation.

### 3. `autonomous_trajectory_rsrp_simulation`
- **Contents**: Simulated dataset from a scenario where the UAV **flies autonomously** using the developed MATLAB simulator.
- **Post-processing Scripts**:
  - `plot_rsrp_simulation.m`: Plots the RSRP measurements during the autonomous flight.
  - `plot_throughput_distance_vs_time_lw12.py`: Plots throughput and distance vs. time for base stations **LW1 and LW2**.
  - `plot_throughput_distance_vs_time_lw34.py`: Plots throughput and distance vs. time for base stations **LW3 and LW4**.
